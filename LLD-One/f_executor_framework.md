## Executor

The `Executor` interface is used to execute tasks. It is a generic interface that can be used to execute any kind of task. The `Executor` interface has only one method:

```java
public interface Executor {
    void execute(Runnable command);
}
```

The `execute` method takes a `Runnable` object as a parameter. The `Runnable` interface is a functional interface that has only one method. Executors internally use a thread pool to execute the tasks. The `execute` method is non-blocking. It returns immediately after submitting the task to the thread pool. The `execute` method is used to execute tasks that do not return a result.

A thread pool is a collection of threads that are used to execute tasks.
Instead of creating a new thread for each task, a thread pool reuses the existing threads to execute the tasks. This improves the performance of the application.

The `Executor` interface has a method called `newCachedThreadPool` that returns an `ExecutorService` object. The `ExecutorService` interface extends the `Executor` interface. The `ExecutorService` interface has methods to execute tasks that return a result. The `ExecutorService` interface also has methods to shutdown the thread pool.

To run a task using the `Executor` interface, we can use the `newCachedThreadPool` method to create an `ExecutorService` object. The `newCachedThreadPool` method returns an `ExecutorService` object that uses a thread pool with a variable number of threads. The `newCachedThreadPool` method creates a new thread for each task if there are no idle threads in the thread pool. If there is an idle thread in the thread pool, the `newCachedThreadPool` method reuses the idle thread to execute the task. The `newCachedThreadPool` method returns an `ExecutorService` object that uses a thread pool with a variable number of threads.

```java
Executor executorService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
executorService.execute(() -> System.out.println("Hello World"));
```

## Callable and Future

Runnables do not return a result. If we want to execute a task that returns a result, we can use the `Callable` interface. The `Callable` interface is a functional interface that has only one method:

```java
public interface Callable<V> {
    V call() throws Exception;
}
```

The `call` method returns a result of type `V`. The `call` method can throw an exception. The `Callable` interface is used to execute tasks that return a result.
For instance we can use the `Callable` interface to execute a task that returns the sum of two numbers:

```java
Callable<Integer> sumTask = () -> 2 + 3;
```

In order to execute a task that returns a result, we can use the `submit` method of the `ExecutorService` interface. The `submit` method takes a `Callable` object as a parameter. The `submit` method returns a `Future` object. The `Future` interface has a method called `get` that returns the result of the task. The `get` method is a blocking method. It waits until the task is completed and then returns the result of the task.

```java
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
Future<Integer> future = executorService.submit(() -> 2 + 3);
Integer result = future.get();
```

Futures can be used to cancel tasks. The `Future` interface has a method called `cancel` that can be used to cancel a task. The `cancel` method takes a boolean parameter. If the boolean parameter is `true`, the task is cancelled even if the task is already running. If the boolean parameter is `false`, the task is cancelled only if the task is not running.

```java
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
Future<Integer> future = executorService.submit(() -> 2 + 3);
future.cancel(false);
```
