# Design Tic-Tac-Toe

## What is Tic-Tac-Toe?

TicTacToe is a 2 player game played on a 3 x 3 board. Each player is allotted a symbol (one X and one O). Initially, the board is empty. Alternatively, each player takes a turn and puts their symbol at any empty slot. The first player to get their symbol over a complete row OR a complete column OR a diagonal wins.

You can play the game within Google Search by just searching for “tictactoe”!

## Questions to Ask
* Will the game be played amongst only 2 players or can there be any number of players in future?
* Is the board size restricted to 3x3 or can it be any NxN?
* Can there be different ways to win?
* Can one of the players be a bot?
* Feature Suggestions:
    * Do we want to time a move? Skip/ Declare the other person as winner if the move doesn’t happen within x seconds.
    * Do we want to support undo operation?
    * Can there be some players who are just watching? Not playing.
    * Do we want to store analytics? Basically previous games, who played what move etc.
    * Support for tournaments? Basically a set of matches, each match between 2 players of the tournament.

## Expectations
* The code should be working and functionally correct
* Good software design practices should be followed:
* Code should be modular, readable, extensible
* Separation of concern should be addressed
* Project structured well across multiple files/ packages
* Write unit tests
* No need of GUI


## Problem Requirements
* Board can be of any NxN size.
* There can be two players.
* Each player will be allotted a symbol.
* The symbol can be one of O and X.
* The players can be either humans or bots.
* Each human player will have a name, email and profile image.
* Each bot player will have a difficulty level.
* Any random player can start the game.
* Then the players will take turns alternatively.
* The player with any consecutive N symbols in a row, column or diagonal wins.
* If the board is full and no player has won, the game is a draw.

### Use Case Diagram
```plantuml

    HumanPlayer -- (Register)

}

```

### API or CLI Design
The usecase diagram gives us a good idea of the API design. We can have the following APIs:
* Register a player
    * `API` - `POST /register` - `{"name": "Paul Morphy", "email": "blind@chess.in", ...}`
    * `CLI` - `tictactoe register --name <name> --email <email> --profile-image <profile-image>`
* Start a game
    * `API` - `POST /game/start` - `{"player1": "paul", "player2": "bot", "board-size": 3}`
    * `CLI` - `tictactoe start --player1 <player1> --player2 <player2> --board-size <board-size>`
* Make a move
    * `API` - `POST /game/move` - `{"player": "paul", "row": 1, "column": 2}`
    * `CLI` - `tictactoe move --player <player> --row <row> --column <column>`

### Class Diagram

#### Initial design
```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Game {
    - Board board
    - HumanPlayer humanPlayer
    - BotPlayer botPlayer
    +startGame(HumanPlayer, BotPlayer, int)
    +makeMove(PlayerId, int, int)
    +checkWinner(Board, HumanPlayer, BotPlayer) : PlayerId
    +registerPlayer(HumanPlayer)
  }

  class Board {
    -Cell[][] cells
    +Board(int size) : Board
  }

  class Cell {
    -int row
    -int column
    -Symbol symbol
  }

  class HumanPlayer {
    -String name
    -String email
    -Byte[] profileImage
    +play(Board) BoardCell
  }

  class BotPlayer {
    -Level difficultyLevel
    +play(Board) BoardCell

  }

  Game "1" --* "1" Board
  Game "1" --* "*" HumanPlayer
  Game "1" --* "1" BotPlayer

  Board "1" --* "*" Cell
```

**Problems:**
* The Game class is tightly coupled with the HumanPlayer and BotPlayer classes. It is not extensible to support any other type of player and number of players.
* There is no common contract for the players.
* `Huge memory consumption` - A player can play multiple games at the same time. Each will have a new `HumanPlayer` object. Each player object will have the profile image. This will consume a lot of memory.
* Implementing the `play` method for the bot player will lead to SRP and OCP violations because it will be deciding the move based on the difficulty level. This will lead to a lot of if-else conditions.

#### Adding a contract for players using an abstract class
```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Game {
    - Board board
    - Player[] players
    +startGame(Player[], int)
    +makeMove(PlayerId, int, int)
    +checkWinner(Board, HumanPlayer, BotPlayer) : PlayerId
    +registerPlayer(Player)
  }

  class Player {
    <<abstract>>
    -Symbol symbol
    +play(Board) BoardCell
  }

  class HumanPlayer {
    -String name
    -String email
    -Byte[] profileImage
    +play(Board) BoardCell
  }

  class BotPlayer {
    -Level difficultyLevel
    +play(Board) BoardCell

  }

  Game "1" --* "*" Player
  Player <|-- HumanPlayer
  Player <|-- BotPlayer
```

**Problems so far:**
* ~~The Game class is tightly coupled with the HumanPlayer and BotPlayer classes. It is not extensible to support any other type of player and number of players.~~
* ~~There is no common contract for the players.~~
* `Huge memory consumption` - A player can play multiple games at the same time. Each will have a new `HumanPlayer` object. Each player object will have the profile image. This will consume a lot of memory.
* Implementing the `play` method for the bot player will lead to SRP and OCP violations because it will be deciding the move based on the difficulty level. This will lead to a lot of if-else conditions.

#### Solving the memory consumption problem using Flyweight pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Game {
    - Board board
    - Player[] players
    +startGame(Player[], int)
    +makeMove(PlayerId, int, int)
    +checkWinner(Board, Player[]) : Player
    +registerPlayer(Player)
  }

  class Player {
    <<abstract>>
    -Symbol symbol
    +play(Board) BoardCell
  }

  class HumanPlayer {
    -User user
    +play(Board) BoardCell
  }

  class User {
    -String name
    -String email
    -Byte[] profileImage
  }

  class BotPlayer {
    -Level difficultyLevel
    +play(Board) BoardCell
  }

  Game "1" --* "*" Player
  HumanPlayer "*" --o "1" User
  Player <|-- HumanPlayer
  Player <|-- BotPlayer

```

**Problems so far:**
* ~~`Huge memory consumption` - A player can play multiple games at the same time. Each will have a new `HumanPlayer` object. Each player object will have the profile image. This will consume a lot of memory.~~
* Implementing the `play` method for the bot player will lead to SRP and OCP violations because it will be deciding the move based on the difficulty level. This will lead to a lot of if-else conditions.

#### Fixing the SRP and OCP violations using Strategy pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class BotPlayer {
    -Level difficultyLevel
    -MoveStrategy moveStrategy
    +play(Board) BoardCell
  }

    class MoveStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        +makeMove(Board) BoardCell
    }

    class RandomMoveStrategy {
        +makeMove(Board) BoardCell
    }

    class ClusteringMoveStrategy {
        +makeMove(Board) BoardCell
    }

    class MinimaxMoveStrategy {
        +makeMove(Board) BoardCell
    }

    BotPlayer "*" --o "1" MoveStrategy
    MoveStrategy <|-- RandomMoveStrategy
    MoveStrategy <|-- ClusteringMoveStrategy
    MoveStrategy <|-- MinimaxMoveStrategy
```

**Problems so far:**
* ~~`Huge memory consumption` - A player can play multiple games at the same time. Each will have a new `HumanPlayer` object. Each player object will have the profile image. This will consume a lot of memory.~~
* ~~Implementing the `play` method for the bot player will lead to SRP and OCP violations because it will be deciding the move based on the difficulty level. This will lead to a lot of if-else conditions.~~

### Future requirement - Different winning conditions for different number of players

* We want to support different winning conditions for different number of players.
* Games can same winning conditions for different number of players and different winning conditions for same number of players.
* Solution - Use a strategy pattern to decide the winning condition for a game.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Game {
    - Board board
    - Player[] players
    - WinningStrategy winningStrategy
    +startGame(Player[], int)
    +makeMove(PlayerId, int, int)
    +checkWinner(Board, Player[]) : Player
    +registerPlayer(Player)
  }

  class WinningStrategy {
    <<interface>>
    +checkWinner(Board, Player[]) : Player
  }

    class NInARowWinningStrategy {
        +checkWinner(Board, Player[]) : Player
    }

    class NInAColumnWinningStrategy {
        +checkWinner(Board, Player[]) : Player
    }

    class NInADiagonalWinningStrategy {
        +checkWinner(Board, Player[]) : Player
    }

    Game "*" --o "1" WinningStrategy
    WinningStrategy <|-- NInARowWinningStrategy
    WinningStrategy <|-- NInAColumnWinningStrategy
    WinningStrategy <|-- NInADiagonalWinningStrategy
```

## Implementation of Tic Tac Toe

### Version V0 
* Implement all the basic requirements. 
* API's : 
  * initiateGame() : helps create an instance of Game based on size of board, List<player>, List<winningStrategy>.
  * startGame() : helps to start the game and ask to makeMove for every player turn until draw or win.
  * createHumanPlayer() : helps create human player with details from user like name, symbol.
  * createBotPlayer() : helps create bot player with details from user like name, symbol, difficulty level. 
* Follow a 3 tier architecture and use different packages based on responsibility. /controllers, /services, /models, /exceptions, /dtos, /enums, /strategies, /factories etc.

### Improvements Needed after V0 version of Tic Tac Toe.  
* makeMove() method of HumanPlayer is tightly coupled with input type e.g., CommandLine interface , RestAPI interface etc. 
* Adding support for Undo operation. 

### Version V1 
* Use strategy pattern to avoid input type tightly coupled with makeMove() implementation. 
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
  class HumanPlayerInputStrategy {
  <<interface>>
  +makeMove(Board) : Move
  }
  
      class CommandLineInputStrategy {
        +makeMove(Board) : Move
      }
  
    HumanPlayerInputStrategy <|-- CommandLineInputStrategy
  ```
* To support Undo operation.
  * Maintain Stack<Move> in Game class 
  * We can ask after every move if they want to undo?

## Side assignment (Feature Suggestions)
* A common requirement in games is to undo the last move. How would you design your system to support this requirement?
* Replay of Moves. 
* Create this as a new SpringBoot application with API's exposed so that in future I can connect to Frontend. So, that I can put it in my resume.
