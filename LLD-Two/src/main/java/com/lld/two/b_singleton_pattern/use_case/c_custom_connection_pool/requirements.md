# Connection Pool

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with designing a connection pool for a database management module of a complex software application. The connection pool is responsible for managing database connections efficiently to avoid unnecessary overhead and ensure optimal resource usage. To prevent multiple instances of the connection pool manager and ensure thread-safe access to connections, you need to implement the Singleton design pattern along with the connection pool management functionality.

## Assignment

Your task is to implement the `ConnectionPool` interface that follows the Singleton design pattern to manage a pool of database connections.

### Part 1: Implementing Singleton and Connection Pool

1. **Implement the Singleton design pattern**: Create a class that implements the `ConnectionPool` interface. Implement the Singleton design pattern within this class to ensure that only one instance of the connection pool manager can exist within the program.

2. **Implement the `getInstance(int maxConnections)` and `resetInstance()` methods**: Implement the `getInstance(int maxConnections)` method in the `ConnectionPoolSolution` class. This method should return the singleton instance of the connection pool manager class. Also, implement the `resetInstance()` method to reset the singleton instance to `null`.

### Part 2: Connection Pool Management

In connection pooling, the aim is to efficiently handle a group of database connections. This ensures optimal resource usage and effective sharing of connections across different parts of the software.

> Here's an analogy to help you understand the concept of connection pooling. Imagine a library with a large collection of books. The library has a shelf where all the books are kept. When a reader wants to borrow a book, they go to the shelf, pick up the book, and take it to a reading table. When they are done reading, they return the book to the shelf. The library keeps track of which books are available and which ones are currently being used by readers.

You have to implement the following methods:

- `void initializePool()`: This method is responsible for initializing the connection pool. It should create a fixed number of connections and add them to the pool. Use the `DummyConnection` class to create dummy connections. Store the connections in a data structure of your choice, but you will have to track which connections are available and which ones are currently in use.
- `Connection getConnection()`: This method is responsible for providing a connection to the caller. It should return a connection from the pool of available connections. Once a connection is returned, it should be marked as "unavailable" so that other parts of the software don't use it.
- `void releaseConnection(Connection connection)`: This method is responsible for releasing a connection back to the pool. It should mark the connection as "available" so that other parts of the software can use it.
- `int getAvailableConnectionsCount()`: Implement this method to count how many "available" connections remain in the pool.
- `int getTotalConnectionsCount()`: This method is about determining the total number of connections, whether they are currently in use or not.

### Instructions

1. Implement the `ConnectionPool` interface and the required methods as specified above.
2. Ensure that your implementation follows the Singleton design pattern and provides proper connection pool management.
3. Run the provided test cases in the `ConnectionPoolTest` class to verify the correctness of your implementation.
